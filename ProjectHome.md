Today many applications integrate with legacy mainframe systems build upon fixed formatted text files as the protocol for interchanging data.

Fixedformat4j is an easy to use Java framework for working with these kind of fixed formatted text files. By annotating your code you can setup the offsets and format for your data when reading/writing to and from fixed format files.

Fixedformat4j handles many datatypes like, string, integer, float, double, bigdecmial, date, boolean, character, etc. out-of-the-box, and it is straight forward to plugin your own formatter.
